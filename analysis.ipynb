    "# YouTube Watch History Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube has become an essential part of many people's daily lives. It serves as a platform for entertainment, learning, and relaxation. This project focuses on analyzing YouTube watch history data to gain insights into viewing patterns and habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "The project aims to achieve both general descriptive approaches and more personalized analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of YouTube usage habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I'd like to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantify Viewing Activity**: Determine the total number of videos watched and the total watch hours over the specified period.\n",
    "2. **Explore Daily Viewing Patterns**: Calculate the average time spent watching YouTube videos each day.\n",
    "3. **Identify Most Watched Videos**: Determine the most watched videos on the YouTube history data based on the number of views.\n",
    "4. **Analyze Video Titles**: Extract and analyze the most common keywords in video titles to identify recurring themes.\n",
    "5. **Discover Peak Viewing Days**: Identify the specific days when the highest number of videos were watched and the number of likes received.\n",
    "6. **Know the longest timeframe where you haven't used YouTube**.\n",
    "7. **Find the most viewed, liked, or commented videos watched**.\n",
    "8. **Show the longest video watched**.\n",
    "9. **Get to know favorite channels**.\n",
    "10. **Analyze each tag from videos**.\n",
    "11. **Analyze the distribution of watch times throughout the day**.\n",
    "12. **Identify trends in video consumption over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I will perform more personalized analysis through my own YouTube History data along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The source dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this analysis was created using a two-step process that involved web scraping and API requests to gather comprehensive information about my YouTube watch history.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I used a Python script called youtube_scraper.py to extract data from an HTML file of my YouTube History. This HTML file was obtained through Google Takeout, which provides a detailed export of a user's YouTube activity. Using the BeautifulSoup library, the script parsed the HTML file to extract essential information for each video, including the video title, URL, the time it was played, the channel that posted it, and the channel's URL. This information was then saved into a CSV file named history.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the HTML file from Google Takeout did not provide all the details I wanted for my analysis. To enrich the dataset with additional information, I created another Python script named youtube_api.py. This script aimed to fill in the gaps by fetching more data through the YouTube Data API. For each video entry in history.csv, the script extracted the video ID from the URL. With the video ID in hand, the script made API requests to gather further details such as the video's duration, the number of likes and dislikes it had received, and the total number of comments. This additional data provided a more comprehensive view of each video that will allow us to perform deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extraction Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Google Takeout**:\n",
    "    - The initial dataset was downloaded from Google Takeout, which provided an HMTL file containing basic information about each video watched, including the video title, timestamp, link, and channel name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **YouTube API**:\n",
    "    - Using the video IDs extracted from the Google Takeout dataset, the YouTube Data API was used to retrieve additional information. \n",
    "    - A script was written in Python to interact with the YouTube Data API. This script performed the following steps:\n",
    "        1. **Authenticate**: Connect to the YouTube Data API using an API key.\n",
    "        2. **Request Data**: For each video ID, send a request to the YouTube API to fetch video details.\n",
    "        3. **Parse Response**: Extract relevant information from the API response, such as video tags, number of likes, number of comments, and other metadata.\n",
    "        4. **Merge Data**: Combine the additional information from the YouTube API with the original Google Takeout data to create a more comprehensive dataset and output it in a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Scripts and notebooks for extracting and collecting data from Google Takeout.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Steps to clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Notebooks containing analysis and visualizations to uncover insights and trends.\n",
    "- **Results**: Summary of findings and key takeaways from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`\n",
    "2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "3. **Run Notebooks**: Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before we begin\n",
    "I'd like to inform you that the results and insights presented here might not fully correspond to realistic viewing habits due to several factors that can affect data integrity. For example, if you use multiple YouTube accounts, the data from just one account might not provide a complete picture. Additionally, there are other scenarios that can potentially impact the results, which I will mention as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, I only use one YouTube account, so all the videos I've watched are perfectly stored in the dataset. However, I still expect to encounter discrepancies due to other factors.\n"
