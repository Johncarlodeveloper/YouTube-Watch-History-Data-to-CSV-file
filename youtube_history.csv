Python Project to Scrape YouTube using YouTube Data API | Analyze and Visualize YouTube data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwSbnmqk3zY,techTFQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnz-ZXXER4jOvuED5trXfEA,"Jun 2, 2024, 9:55:16 PM PST",SwSbnmqk3zY,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SwSbnmqk3zY/default.jpg,2021-10-13T13:00:13Z,131887.0,3850.0,0.0,283.0,"In this video, we build a Python Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. Using YouTube API, we extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data. Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.

Link to create YouTube API Key: https://console.cloud.google.com/
Link to Google YouTube Data API documentation: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
Link to my blog where you can download this project for free: https://techtfq.com/video/python-project-to-scrape-youtube-using-youtube-data-api

Timestamp:
00:00 Intro
01:19 How to generate YouTube API Key
03:27 Google YouTube Data API Documentation
07:48 Pre Requisite for project (Creating virtual environment and install python packages)
09:45 Part 1 - Scrape Channel statistics from youtube. Analyze and Visualize YouTube channel
32:32 Part 2 - Scrape Video details for a youtube channel. Analyze and Visualize video details.

We start this project by first creating an YouTube API Key which will be our credential to access youtube data. I will should you in detail, how to create an API Key. 
Once the API Key is generated, we will then learn how to use this API key to access different youtube data. I.e. we will walk through the documentation given by google to use youtube API. We will look at the different sections in the documentation to access different data we need to build this project. We will also look at the sample python code given by google to call different resources and methods to fetch youtube data.

Finally, we will get into writing the python code to build this project. I will be using Jupyter Notebook to write my python code. Since it is a new project, we will create a new virtual environment for this project. We will use anaconda for this. Once the virtual environment is set, we will then install all the required python packages. So we will install ""google-api-python-client"" (which is the google python package required to access youtube api data), we will also install pandas and seaborn. I will show you how to create a virtual environment and also how to install all these packages in detail.

Once our environment is set and required packages are installed, we will then start writing the code in Jupyter Notebook. I have divided this project into 2 parts.
In the first part, we extract channel details from youtube. I.e. we extract details such as youtube channel name, total no of subscribers, total views and total number of videos posted by each channel. We gather these details for few Data Analyst/Data Scientist kind of channel and then compare these channel data with each other. We shall see who has the highest subscriber and who gets the most views and the amount of videos posted by these channels. We will be loading all of this data into a pandas dataframe and then analyze it. We will also generate some basic visualization using this data so we can easily compare these multiple channels.

In the second part of the video, we shall build a logic to extract video details from a particular channel. We shall extract details such as video title, total views each video has got, total number of likes, dislikes and comments each video has got. We shall extract these details for all of the videos posted by a particular channel. We will then analyze this data by loading it into a pandas dataframe. At the end we will create some simple visualization using Seaborn python library.

Hopefully, this can be a good starting project for anyone aspiring to become a Data Analyst. If you find this video useful then please make sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel.

Lyrics:
We‚Äôre no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking of
You wouldn‚Äôt get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I‚Äôm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We‚Äôve known each other for so long
Your heart‚Äôs been aching but you‚Äôre too shy to say it
Inside we both know what‚Äôs been going on
We know the game and we‚Äôre gonna play it

And if you ask me how I‚Äôm feeling
Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Amsterdam Sinfonietta
Candida Thompson [violin/direction]
Ray Chen [viool]

On the musical program:
Giuseppe Tartini - Violin Sonata in G minor, Bg.5 / Devil's Trill Sonata (arr. for solo violin and strings)

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

I played around with a brand new silhouette and fabric and let's just say... I'm obsessed üëó #fashion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqB7hVyP0ps,blogilates,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg,"May 29, 2024, 8:16:16 PM PST",vqB7hVyP0ps,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vqB7hVyP0ps/default.jpg,2023-04-20T20:07:59Z,83246238.0,3086333.0,0.0,34298.0,"Shop the Superdress https://bit.ly/3oq3kJD

I truly believe that women‚Äôs clothing has to be designed in a way that moves WITH our bodies, not against it. I‚Äôm sick of dresses that restrict me! Like can‚Äôt I pick up something I dropped without worrying if my underwear is showing? Can‚Äôt I not have to cross my legs bc I‚Äôm afraid of someone is going to look up my skirt? I‚Äôm tired of it. I feel like I‚Äôve got work to do outside the activewear space too if I‚Äôm going to make a real change in women‚Äôs clothing‚Ä¶

Anyway, I want to share with you my latest @popflexactive workout dress design‚Ä¶I call this my ‚ú®Superdress‚ú®!

I am playing with a brand new silhouette and fabric, and I‚Äôm loooove how sleek it turned out. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs up:

‚úîÔ∏è anti-üê´ shorts with no front seam
‚úîÔ∏è pockets cuz duh
‚úîÔ∏è stretchy lightweight fabric bc breathing and eating are v important
‚úîÔ∏è thick, adjustable straps bc ‚ú®comfort‚ú® and all our torsos are diff
‚úîÔ∏è square neckline bc Bridgerton boobs obvs
‚úîÔ∏è waist snatching panel cuz always
‚úîÔ∏è slit bc it‚Äôs cute but also helps with leg movement
‚úîÔ∏è longer skirt in the back for booty coverage
‚úîÔ∏èXXS-3X

I‚Äôm trying a new pattern that‚Äôs a bit less twirly so that it gives more of a simplistic elegance. I love the sleek lines so much.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, normally a small, wearing an XS HOWEVER I think you should get your normal size. I am very very particular when it comes to dresses. I size down in dresses for all brands bc I like the extra snatch it gives my waist and the extra lift it gives my boobs, but I think you‚Äôll be safer in your normal size! Also one more thing! If you plan on getting black, size up from your normal size! The black dye made the fabric a tad less stretchy so you‚Äôll want to account for that.

The Superdress is on popflexactive.com @popflexactive in 4 colors! Which is your fave?

What Happens After Gunshot to the Abdomen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LlKIwv2X1c,Dr Wealz,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbvHC7HP2hJ4zcIVfelTtZg,"May 29, 2024, 8:11:55 PM PST",8LlKIwv2X1c,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8LlKIwv2X1c/default.jpg,2022-11-21T19:23:28Z,126540.0,5284.0,0.0,60.0,"When a bullet penetrates the body, it crushes and rips the tissue in its path, leaving a permanent cavity. The impact energy is dispersed in a shock wave that spirally flings surrounding tissue away from the path of the projectile, creating a cavity greater than the diameter of the bullet, which is known as the temporary stress cavity. Before a permanent wound track forms, the temporary stress cavity lasts for around 5 to 10 milliseconds with a succession of progressively smaller pulsations and contractions. The kinetic energy at impact, the size of the temporary cavity, and the quantity of bullet fragmentation all contribute to the final extent of the wound. #shorts #bullet #wound #gunshot  #abdomen

Resident Evil: Retribution Movie CLIP - I Don't Work For Umbrella (2012) - Milla Jovovich Movie HD


The Umbrella Corporation¬ís deadly T-virus continues to ravage the Earth, transforming the global population into legions of the flesh eating Undead. The human race¬ís last and only hope, Alice, awakens in the heart of Umbrella's most clandestine operations facility and unveils more of her mysterious past as she delves further into the complex. Without a safe haven, Alice continues to hunt those responsible for the outbreak; a chase that takes her from Tokyo to New York, Washington, D.C. and Moscow, culminating in a mind-blowing revelation that will force her to rethink everything that she once thought to be true. Aided by newfound allies and familiar friends, Alice must fight to survive long enough to escape a hostile world on the brink of oblivion. The countdown has begun.","Resident Evil 5,Milla Jovovich,Sienna Guillory,Shawn Roberts,Oded Fehr,Michelle Rodriguez,Johann Urb,zombies,undead,umbrella corporation,Paul WS Andersen,movieclips,movieclipsdotcom,movieclipstrailers,thetrailercats,popuptrailers,Alice,trailer 2,resident evil commercial,dcoscarelli,zefr,Timmons"

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Lyrics: 
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Lyrics:
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

Bring the beat in

Honey honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody ask me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take a little work)
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need to make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooh come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Ooh ooh
Come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
My love on top
Baby I can hear the wind whip past my face
As we dance the night away
And boy your look it tastes like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again and again and again and again
Now everybody ask me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need to make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooh baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Ooh ooh
Come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
Put my love on top
My love on top
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you baby everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Baby you're the one that I love
Baby you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Baby cause you're the one that I love

Lyrics:

OoooohhaaaahhhhhOhhhaaaahhhh.......

[Verse 1]
Can somebody explain to me
Why everybody is trying to be
Living like a celebrity
Doing what they see on MTV.
Ice is cool but I am looking for more, simple things is what my heart beats for.

Cause that's me
I don't ask for much
Baby
Having you is enough

[Chorus]
You ain't got to buy nothing
It's not what I want
Baby it's You
We don't have to go nowhere
Its not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not for what you got
I know you got a lot
No matter what you do
You always gettin Hot
It's You,
It's You
Baby all I want is You Yeah

[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter that your car is fly
And your rims are spinning on the side and
It doesn't matter where we go tonight
Cause if I'm with you I'll be alright.
That's cool but I'm lookin for more
Its your love that my heart beats for.

Cause thats me
Don't have to spend a dime
Baby
I just want your time.

[Chorus]
[Musical Break]
Ooooohhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
Oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh.......

Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: ""Who Is Salt?""-

Up next, Harvard negotiator explains how to argue ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/IDj1OBG5Tpw

Bo Seo, an author and two-time world debate champion, believes our public conversations are in crisis. To Seo, our arguing skills have collectively atrophied over recent decades, resulting in bad arguments that have caused many people to lose faith in the idea that productive disagreements are even possible. 

That's why Seo suggests a framework called RISA ‚Äî which stands for ""Real, Important, Specific, and Aligned"" ‚Äî to help people pick their fights more wisely and to give conversations the best possible chance of success. RISA helps individuals find a better way to disagree.

Seo believes that by making a contract with the other party and reminding them of the rules, conversations can be productive, and disagreements can lead to progress.

Lyrics

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

lyrics üìÉ
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whisk–µy neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for m–µ
You're too sweet for me
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong
You know you're bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

LYRIC:

Voc√™, me faz t√£o bem
Me trata como um nen√©m
Quero sempre estar, no seu colo ficar
E te levar pro cora√ß√£o

Pega vis√£o
√â dif√≠cil, mas n√£o existe um n√£o
Deslizando em seu corpo
Te mordendo todo, todo
Duvido que vai falar n√£o

N√£o para n√£o
Continua at√© ent√£o eu falar
Pra parar

Somos bem fofinhos
Brutos com carinho
Me beija
Me enlouque√ßa

O clima aqui est√° muito bom pode me beijar
S√≥ olha antes da sua irm√£ n√£o nos pegar
Quero aproveitar isso aqui at√© o mundo acabar
√â com voc√™ que quero ficar

Segue o flow, flow
Tira blusa e pede um show, show
Me deslumbro esse seu corpo
Me avisa pra eu te dar beijo

A vida pede para ter comigo
N√£o importa o quanto est√° sozinho
Trago paz pro seu abrigo
Ent√£o me deixa eu estar contigo

N√£o para n√£o
Continua at√© ent√£o eu falar
Pra parar

Somos bem fofinhos
Brutos com carinho
Me beija
Me enlouque√ßa

O clima aqui est√° muito bom pode me beijar
S√≥ olha antes da sua irm√£ n√£o nos pegar
Quero aproveitar isso aqui at√© o mundo acabar
√â com voc√™ que quero ficar

Ficar
Ficar
Ficar

O clima aqui est√° muito bom pode me beijar
S√≥ olha antes da sua irm√£ n√£o nos pegar
Quero aproveitar isso aqui at√© o mundo acabar
√â com voc√™ que quero ficar

Francis, trained in avalanche-rescue protocol, sprung into action to clear Ian's airway.

The mountains don't care how much experience you have or how careful you are. Accidents can and will happen‚Äîriding with company that is prepared and educated is the best way to stay safe in dangerous terrain.

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

At its core, the story of The Hunger Games is about the power of one person to change the world.

Set in the future remnants of the USA in a new nation called Panem, one male and one female ""tribute"" between the ages of 11 and 18 from each of Panem's twelve districts is forced to participate in an annual competition called the Hunger Games, which is broadcast live throughout the country for the entertainment of the Capitol's wealthy residents.

Now, bestselling author Suzanne Collins and the world of The Hunger Games return in her latest addition to the series: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.","Hunger Games,Catching Fire,Katniss Everdeen,Peeta Mellark,Peacekeepers,District 12,Suzanne Collins,dystopian,Jennifer Lawrence,Josh Hutcherson,rebellion,Capitol,movie clip,heroism,defiance,conflict,social control,dystopian society,movie moment,epic scene,sci-fi movie,blockbuster,drama,action,tension,Hunger Games sequel,Panem,District rebellion,political unrest,Liam Hemsworth,Gale Hawthorne,Katniss Takes Care of Peeta,Katniss Peeta"

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

It is sometimes referred to as the ""Great G minor symphony,"" to distinguish it from the ""Little G minor symphony,"" No. 25. The two are the only minor key symphonies Mozart wrote. The 40th Symphony was completed on 25 July 1788. The composition occupied an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks in 1788, during which time he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies (26 June and 10 August, respectively). The symphony is scored (in its revised version) for flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, and strings. Notably missing are trumpets and timpani.
The work is in four movements, in the usual arrangement (fast movement, slow movement, minuet, fast movement) for a classical-style symphony:
1. Molto allegro, 2/2
2. Andante, 6/8
3. Menuetto. Allegretto -- Trio, 3/4
4. Finale. Allegro assai, 2/2.
Every movement but the third is in sonata form; the minuet and trio are in the usual ternary form. This work has elicited varying interpretations from critics. Robert Schumann regarded it as possessing ""Grecian lightness and grace"". Donald Francis Tovey saw in it the character of opera buffa. Almost certainly, however, the most common perception today is that the symphony is tragic in tone and intensely emotional; for example, Charles Rosen (in The Classical Style) has called the symphony ""a work of passion, violence, and grief.""
Although interpretations differ, the symphony is unquestionably one of Mozart's most greatly admired works, and it is frequently performed and recorded. Ludwig van Beethoven knew the symphony well, copying out 29 measures from the score in one of his sketchbooks. It is thought that the opening theme of the last movement may have inspired Beethoven in composing the third movement of his Fifth Symphony.

This is the original complete recording of the Sonata the way it was meant to be. Back in those days there was a 10 minutes file limit and therefore I had to split performance in 2 parts. The 3rd movement went viral while the first file did not. Playlist does not work in the opposite way and there are hundreds of channels that stole my recording and rebroadcast it in full. So I should have it published  as it was played. Enjoy! I think when performed complete the concept of the performance is different.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

It was supposedly completed October 5, a mere two days after the completion of his Symphony No. 24, although this remains unsubstantiated. Its first movement is widely known as the opening music in Milo≈° Forman's film Amadeus. The symphony is laid out in standard classical form:
1. Allegro con brio, 4/4 in G minor
2. Andante, 2/4 in E-flat major
3. Menuetto & Trio, 3/4 in G minor, Trio in G major
4. Allegro, 4/4 in G minor.
With its wide-leap melodic lines and brisk musical subjects, this symphony is characteristic of the Sturm und Drang style. It shares certain features with other Sturm und Drang symphonies of this time, and is likely inspired from Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 39 which is likewise in G minor. The opening Mannheim rocket (a rising arpeggiated sequence) was quoted by Beethoven in his first Piano Sonata as the principal subject of the first movement.

This is the original complete recording of the Sonata the way it was meant to be. Back in those days there was a 10 minutes file limit and therefore I had to split performance in 2 parts. The 3rd movement went viral while the first file did not. Playlist does not work in the opposite way and there are hundreds of channels that stole my recording and rebroadcast it in full. So I should have it published  as it was played. Enjoy! I think when performed complete the concept of the performance is different.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

La Campanella , or Feux Follets ( both are clearly hinted here) are walk in a park in comparison....Early Liszt, from the period when he honestly thought that piano being a percussive instrument there is no point of making any attempt at legato,and one might as well enjoy frolicking in most head-spinning skips and repeated notes :-) The piece (which is based on Manuel Garcia's popular song) was titled in the first edition as ""Op.5 #2"". Funny , I think that was the last piece Liszt gave an opus number, anticipating how many works he is going to write :) Liszt intended this piece as a bravura finale for his recitals - but according to many reports , he failed utterly . Too difficult???? LOL
A friend of mine who used to present great Soviet artists on their tours in Italy told me that the only person who played it LIVE was Pletnev. But even then Pletnev told him that he quit on this piece , calling it ""unplayable"". You can check for yourself - the music is available freely here:

http://tinyurl.com/6rdv2h8

Let me know how far you progress, OK ? It makes for an easy sight-reading. But do pay attention to indicated tempo marks. They are truly insane :-) 
For some fun go to middle of page 22 or page 28 and tell me how you like it :-) A hint... it would make for a hilarious video. Hitting those notes is a gamble no matter how many days spent practicing. La Campanella infamous skips are two octaves shorter ....

It is sometimes referred to as the ""Great G minor symphony,"" to distinguish it from the ""Little G minor symphony,"" No. 25. The two are the only minor key symphonies Mozart wrote. The 40th Symphony was completed on 25 July 1788. The composition occupied an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks in 1788, during which time he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies (26 June and 10 August, respectively). The symphony is scored (in its revised version) for flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, and strings. Notably missing are trumpets and timpani.
The work is in four movements, in the usual arrangement (fast movement, slow movement, minuet, fast movement) for a classical-style symphony:
1. Molto allegro, 2/2
2. Andante, 6/8
3. Menuetto. Allegretto -- Trio, 3/4
4. Finale. Allegro assai, 2/2.
Every movement but the third is in sonata form; the minuet and trio are in the usual ternary form. This work has elicited varying interpretations from critics. Robert Schumann regarded it as possessing ""Grecian lightness and grace"". Donald Francis Tovey saw in it the character of opera buffa. Almost certainly, however, the most common perception today is that the symphony is tragic in tone and intensely emotional; for example, Charles Rosen (in The Classical Style) has called the symphony ""a work of passion, violence, and grief.""
Although interpretations differ, the symphony is unquestionably one of Mozart's most greatly admired works, and it is frequently performed and recorded. Ludwig van Beethoven knew the symphony well, copying out 29 measures from the score in one of his sketchbooks. It is thought that the opening theme of the last movement may have inspired Beethoven in composing the third movement of his Fifth Symphony.

As you blow the air in, low pressure in the high-speed airflow will be created because of Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle. This low pressure will suck the surrounding air into the bag.

Lyrics:
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) gets attacked by the knife-wielding Navajas (Danny Trejo), who also puts away a car full of henchmen.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director Robert Rodriguez picks up where his successful independent debut El Mariachi left off with this slam-bang South of the Border action saga. Bucho (Joaquim DeAlmeida) is a wealthy but casually bloodthirsty drug kingpin who rules a seedy Mexican border town. Bucho and his men make the mistake of angering El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas), a former musician who now carries an arsenal in his guitar case. Bucho was responsible for the death of El Mariachi's girlfriend and put a bullet through his fretting hand, making him unable to play the guitar. Bent on revenge, the musician-turned-killing machine arrives in town to put Bucho out of business, though he finds few allies except for Carolina (Salma Hayek), who runs a bookstore that doesn't seem to attract many readers. Desperado features supporting performances from Cheech Marin as a cynical bartender, Steve Buscemi as the cantina patron who sets up the story, and Quentin Tarantino as a man with a really terrible joke to tell.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) makes a big impression with the judges, for breaking the rules.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on the best-selling young-adult novel by author Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games tells the dark tale of a 16-year-old girl named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who is selected to compete in a vicious televised tournament in which 24 teenagers from a post-apocalyptic society fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses. In the future, North America is no more. In its place has risen Panem, a divided nation split into 12 districts. Every year, each district selects a teen of each gender (called ""Tributes"") to test their worth in a competition known as the Hunger Games, which are broadcast across the nation as entertainment, and to reinforce the government's total power. When her younger sister is selected as District 12's latest ""Tribute,"" Katniss volunteers to take her place, and trains under hard-drinking former Hunger Games champion Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to sharpen her killer instincts. Now in order to survive the game and emerge the victor, this young combatant must put all of her skills to the ultimate test. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth co-star.

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

La Campanella , or Feux Follets ( both are clearly hinted here) are walk in a park in comparison....Early Liszt, from the period when he honestly thought that piano being a percussive instrument there is no point of making any attempt at legato,and one might as well enjoy frolicking in most head-spinning skips and repeated notes :-) The piece (which is based on Manuel Garcia's popular song) was titled in the first edition as ""Op.5 #2"". Funny , I think that was the last piece Liszt gave an opus number, anticipating how many works he is going to write :) Liszt intended this piece as a bravura finale for his recitals - but according to many reports , he failed utterly . Too difficult???? LOL
A friend of mine who used to present great Soviet artists on their tours in Italy told me that the only person who played it LIVE was Pletnev. But even then Pletnev told him that he quit on this piece , calling it ""unplayable"". You can check for yourself - the music is available freely here:

http://tinyurl.com/6rdv2h8

Let me know how far you progress, OK ? It makes for an easy sight-reading. But do pay attention to indicated tempo marks. They are truly insane :-) 
For some fun go to middle of page 22 or page 28 and tell me how you like it :-) A hint... it would make for a hilarious video. Hitting those notes is a gamble no matter how many days spent practicing. La Campanella infamous skips are two octaves shorter ....

You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

This course was created by Dr. Linda Green, a lecturer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Check out her YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkyLJh6hQS1TlhUZxOMjTFw

This course combines two courses taught by Dr. Green. She teaches both Calculus 1 and a Calculus 1 Corequisite course, designed to be taken at the same time. In this video, the lectures from the Corquisite course, which review important Algebra and Trigonometry concepts, have been interspersed with the Calculus 1 lectures at the places suggested by Dr. Green.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

üîµ ABOUT 

SeeMusic Official - Best of Chopin, Liszt, Mendelssohn!

Hi, my name is Peter - I'm the pianist behind the SeeMusic channel, and the creator of the SeeMusic app.

I use the SeeMusic reactive visualizer to add particles and lights to my piano performances, creating videos that are a captivating fusion of music and technology.  My videos experiment with 3D note styles like gems and crystals.  

As a concert pianist, I enjoy challenging myself with Etudes by Chopin and Liszt.  I'll play the hits, and help you discover new pieces you haven't heard before.  

Subscribe to my channel, and embark on a journey through the realms of classical and cinematic music.

This course is a variant of Harvard College's introduction to computer science, CS50, designed especially for business professionals. Whereas CS50 itself takes a bottom-up approach, emphasizing mastery of low-level concepts and implementation details thereof, this course takes a top-down approach, emphasizing mastery of high-level concepts and design decisions related thereto. Ultimately this course empowers students to make technological decisions even if not technologists themselves. Topics include cloud computing, networking, privacy, scalability, security, and more, with an emphasis on web and mobile technologies. Students emerge from this course with firsthand appreciation of how it all works and all the more confident in the factors that should guide their decision-making. This course is designed for managers, product managers, founders, and decision-makers more generally.

This is Part 1 of a series I'll be doing on the interesting experience known as ""prophantasia"".

Prophantasia describes the ability to not only visually imagine, but to project those images out into our physical field of view. 

I came up with this term back in 2018 to try to help clarify what these different experiences are like!

I describe the key role that errors play in triggering our brains to change and how the vestibular (balance) system can activate and amplify neuroplasticity. As always, I cover science, and science-based practical tools. Thank you in advance for your questions and for your interest in science!

The tutorial is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will  solve two-term quadratic equations, using techniques like the greatest common factor and the difference of two squares formula. In the second part, we will solve quadratic trinomials with a leading coefficient of one and different from one.  We will use techniques like the product-sum method, the AC method, and factoring by grouping. In both parts, after factoring the equations we will apply the zero product property to find the solutions.  Towards the end, we will  cover quadratic equations given in non-standard form and also address the most common mistake made when solving quadratic equations. It also includes how to verify/check the solutions.

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

Antonio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 ‚Äì 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer and virtuoso violinist. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, he is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni). Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered ‚Äì in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

I realised from the latest before/after results video that a lot of people tend to do just 1-2 weeks instead of the whole 4 weeks programs. You obviously won't lose as much weight or get as much results, but a 2 weeks program is easier to commit to, and you can always do it twice!

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Some people may see my video titles as click-bait. YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.

Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. 

When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.","warm up,warm up exercise,warm up exercise before workout,warm up exercise for beginner,warm up routine,warm up routine before workout,warm up workout,warm up workout at home,easy warm up,warm up stretch,good warm up,full body warm up,warm up stretches before workout,home workout,home workout no equipment,5 min workout,5 min warm up,5 min exercise,workout,exercise,fast warm up,quick warm up,effective warm up,home exercise,easy exercise"

How to Manifest Anything You Desire? Law of Attraction.

Universe is you and you are the universe. You are part of this beautiful creation and that Noor - that ray of light is part of all of us. We all are capable to creating and manifesting whatever we want. We are all made up of stars, that starry material, that magic star dust, yes, we are made up of that.... literally. not just you, each one of us, each grain of sand. you are connected to it and it is connected to you. 'Tohi Mohi, Mohi Tohi Antar Kaisa' - this verse from gurbani, says it all. ""You are in Me and I Am in You.. that whats the difference between you and me"" 

You are God and God is in You - There is no difference, and when we meditate on this, when we start to feel that connection with universe, with everyone and every thing around us, then something magically changes inside of us. When we realize that we could have been a flower or a grain of sand, instead of a human being, something changes. Its all connected. 

And once we grasp that part, we can understand how to manifest what we desire. 

But we need to learn to distinguish between 

- those little chemical reactions inside of us - which are induced because of  something we saw on TV or someone else has it - enticing us to go after that something, 

or its a desire - inner desire of the soul, its restless because you are not working towards achieving your higher self. 

Something that can help - is to look for that restless-ness, that uneasiness when everything in your life is comfortable. Thats your soul speaking. It does not understand man-made concepts of money, and cars, and mutual funds. Its an energy,. our soul is an energy.. it wants to be free .. our soul wants to experience life... and anything that makes it feel alive .. is what the universe has planned to manifest through you. More you delay it, more restless you will feel. So ask yourself what makes you feel alive?? and just do it everyday.. feel your soul sing.. And thats what you are attracted to and that thing is attracted to you too.. There is no expectation of end result then, you soul is already free... its not longing for the end result... 

Hope this has helped. Hopefully this 963Hz Solfeggio Frequency based music will help you and meditating along with it will bring you closer to your inner universe. 

Many Blessings and Peace all the Way. 
Smile ~ Laugh ~ Chant ~ Sing ~ Become one with the universe!!

Also called the ‚Äúfrequency of Gods‚Äù, the 963Hz Solfeggio frequency is said to awaken any system to its original, perfect state, as well as to assist in the process of Pineal Gland activation and Third Eye opening. Its tone helps us return to Oneness, to our very source. If you feel disconnected with the rest of the world, the 963 Hz frequency can help complete your awakening with the interconnectedness and Oneness of the Universe. Listening to the frequency of 963 Hz can also strengthen the sense of community and belonging, or restore it if necessary.

639 Hz is a frequency our Heart Chakra resonates with. Our Heart Chakra is the fourth Chakra and the center of the seven Chakras with three Chakras below and three Chakras above. It is the center, the area where physical and spiritual meet. Our Heart Chakra stands for the ability to give and receive Love and forgiveness. It is the center of hope, trust, compassion and inspiration.¬†When our Heart Chakra is open, we may feel being deeply connected, the harmonious exchange of energy with all that is around us, and the appreciation of beauty. 

In the Solfeggio scale, the 396Hz frequency is known to help overcome fear, which usually presents the main obstacle when it comes to realising our dreams and goals. The 396 hz Solfeggio frequency also liberates from negative beliefs, convictions and thoughts, even on a subconscious level. It helps overcome sadness and grief in difficult moments of life and to find our way back to consolation, inner peace and profound joy ‚òÄÔ∏è

For this meditation music, all instruments have been specifically and carefully tuned to 963 Hz + 639 Hz + 396 Hz. These are frequencies, our heart chakra, pineal gland and third eye resonate with and can help overcome and let go of fear, anxiety, worries and stress. The meditation music in this video is an original 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz composition and has not been artificially tuned to 963 Hz + 639 Hz + 396 Hz afterwards. I am convinced that composing music in the original frequency will lead to better results when it comes to deploying the positive energy and benefits of the healing frequencies of 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz. 


Feel free to listen to this 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz Open Up to the Universe | Heart Chakra & Let Go | Healing Meditation Music with headphones or - if you prefer - just let it flow through open space. As long as it is positive for you, it will be positive for your body and soul.

Meditation Instructions:

Lay down on a comfortable position. Start focusing on your breath and let your inner chatter go away. Imagine yourself surrounded by a brilliant light as you close your eyes.
Bring your awareness to your spirit guides and ask them to protect you as you fall into deep sleep. 
Ask them to walk this light thru your chakras as the music changes from a frequency to another, removing all the negative energies, balancing these centers and clearing your Aura.

When you wake up the next morning, sit on your bed and take several deep breaths. Then drink a glass of water before eating your breakfast.

The number of times a week you should do this meditation depends on how you feel about your energy. You may use this meditation when you're feeling low on energy or. By cleansing your aura daily you rid yourself of negative energies that you‚Äôve picked up from other people and the environment so you may use it as a prevention to keep you on a high vibration.

Concerto for harpsichord, strings and basso continuo No. 1 in D minor, BWV 1052

Composed in 1738 during Johann Sebastian Bach's C√∂then period, is thought to be based on a lost violin concerto. It is clear from the manuscript notation that the concerto was composed for the two manuals of the harpsichord. The piece is composed in three movements; the first one was later used by Bach as an organ prelude, and the slow movement became the first chorus of his Cantata No. 146, ""Wir m√ºssen durch viel Tr√ºbsal.""


I. Allegro  (0:00)


Like most of Bach's instrumental concertos, this concerto employs the Italian ritornello form. The ritornello of the first movement is a driving six-bar unison theme whose opening five notes form the foundation for the majority of the movement. The theme's power stems from its ever-expanding leaps and its emphatic closing cadence. Most of the soloist's passages are derived from this theme, but Bach later introduces a chromatic, toccata-like secondary theme for effect. The ritornello immediately gives way to a carefully mapped progression through the neighboring keys, using the dominant minor, the relative major, the relative major of the dominant minor, and so forth. The soloist leads the concerto through sections of contrapuntal and harmonic exploration, interspersed with several varied restatements of the ritornello by the strings. Following an elaborate cadenza by the soloist, the first movement closes with a unison restatement of the ritornello.","Johann,Sebastian,Bach,Harpsichord,Concerto,BWV1052"

To me, these pieces evoke intensity, speed, rhythmic energy, dark chromatic harmonies, and/or general loudness characteristic of metal music.

Vincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night one year before dying.
Chopin composed his popular Nocturne when he was about twenty.
it does not matter if you think that it is too late for you or that you still have a lot of time...you have to decide whether you are Chopin or van Gogh.

The idea behind these videos is coming from a research published by the Psychology Department of Berkeley University studying the relation between colors, emotions and how external stimuli are impacting decision making. 

The study results demonstrate a strong correlation between faster music in minor tone and the choice from participants of colors from that were saturated, yellower and lighter whereas a slower and minor music produced the opposite pattern (choice of desaturated, darker and bluer colors).

Based on these findings, we wanted to create synesthesia in our videos and trigger more intense and long-lasting emotions in our viewers, get higher audience retention and interaction. We decided to do that by associating drawings from the major painters that were following the scientific findings of this research. 
The choice of these paintings and the consecutive association with the music is also based on an accurate work that requires significant time and energy.

The analysis of the melodies returned to us a lot of information on how the painting should have been made. We needed a simple blue pattern but with an intrinsic meaning. Something that people could watch for a while without really understand it.

By creating this video I tried to do only one thing which turned to be the most difficult one: make you feel an emotional synesthesia. 
When hearing the melody, don't you feel that everything is...blue? aren‚Äôt you lost in the sky? is your mind going over? It‚Äôs not for no reason.
it is not only an image, it is not only a melody. It is a trip. 
You don't feel bored. Its your mind using the notes and the colors to create your own experience.

Most of the videos online with only one image are only music, but not this. 

The research behind the perfect combination is the key for the unconscious.

The research:
""Music‚Äìcolor associations are mediated by emotion""

Hans Zimmer - Interstellar - Main Theme
Piano Version by Patrik Pietschmann

Hi, my name is Patrik Pietschmann, I'm a keyboard player, arranger and hobby programmer from Germany. Since I am a huge fan of Hans Zimmer, I did an arrangement of his Main Theme from the ""Interstellar"" soundtrack. In this video I have tried to combine my live piano playing with the visualization of the music material by programming my own ""Synthesia""-like software.

Hans Zimmer - Interstellar - Main Theme
Piano Version by Patrik Pietschmann

Hi, my name is Patrik Pietschmann, I'm a keyboard player, arranger and hobby programmer from Germany. Since I am a huge fan of Hans Zimmer, I did an arrangement of his Main Theme from the ""Interstellar"" soundtrack. In this video I have tried to combine my live piano playing with the visualization of the music material by programming my own ""Synthesia""-like software.

Hi! My name is Jocie, and I'm just a human happy to be creating ASMR videos : )

I post what I enjoy, meaning lots of:
MAKEUP & SKINCARE
PERSONAL ATTENTION
FANTASY ROLEPLAYS
& NATURE

New videos TUESDAYS 6PM EST and/or whenever else I can post!

For someone practicing to slow down & be kind to themselves, I find ASMR gives us a chance for pause, encouraging us to take time for self care and to prioritize our wellbeing. I hope we can all use this channel to practice love, laugh a little, and relax ‚ô° SUBSCRIBE and join in on the tingles!

Bring Me to Life Lyrics
[Verse 1: Amy Lee]
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Bridge: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life, I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch, without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

[Verse 3: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Outro: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Hi! My name is Jocie (they/she), and I'm just a human happy to be creating ASMR videos : )

I post what I enjoy, meaning lots of:

MAKEUP & SKINCARE
PERSONAL ATTENTION
FANTASY ROLEPLAYS
& NATURE

New videos TUESDAYS 6PM EST and/or whenever else I can post!

For someone practicing to slow down & be kind to themselves, I find ASMR gives us a chance for pause, encouraging us to take time for self care and to prioritize our wellbeing. I hope we can all use this channel to practice love, laugh a little, and relax ‚ô° SUBSCRIBE and join in on the tingles!

Hi! My name is Jocie, and I'm just a human happy to be creating ASMR videos : )

I post what I enjoy, meaning lots of:
MAKEUP & SKINCARE
PERSONAL ATTENTION
& NATURE

New uploads every single week!

For someone who struggles to slow down & show themselves love, I find ASMR gives us a chance for pause, encouraging us to take time for self care and to prioritize our mental health. I hope we can all use this channel to practice self love, laugh a little, and relax ‚ô° SUBSCRIBE and join in on the tingles!","asmr,jocie b asmr,jocie asmr,asmr personal attention,asmr shorts,shorts,asmr haircut,asmr hair wash,asmr cozy hair cut"

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Hans Zimmer - Interstellar - Main Theme
Piano Version by Patrik Pietschmann

Hi, my name is Patrik Pietschmann, I'm a keyboard player, arranger and hobby programmer from Germany. Since I am a huge fan of Hans Zimmer, I did an arrangement of his Main Theme from the ""Interstellar"" soundtrack. In this video I have tried to combine my live piano playing with the visualization of the music material by programming my own ""Synthesia""-like software.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Armenian State Symphony Orchestra
Conductor: Sergey Smbatyan

Aram Khachaturian Concert Hall 

Mario Stefano Pietrodarchi naci√≥ en Atessa el 26 de diciembre de 1980. Comenz√≥ a estudiar acorde√≥n a la edad de nueve a√±os antes de pasar m√°s tarde al bandone√≥n. De 1993 a 2001 estudi√≥ en la Escuela de M√∫sica C√≠vica F. Fenaroli de Lanciano con el M¬∞ C. Calista y con el M¬∞ C. Chiacchiaretta. En 2007 se gradu√≥ con honores en el Conservatorio de M√∫sica Santa Cecilia de Roma.

La Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Estatal de Armenia fue fundada por el director Sergey Smbatyan, quien tambi√©n es el director art√≠stico y director principal de la orquesta. Inicialmente fundada como la Orquesta Juvenil Estatal de Armenia, la devoci√≥n de los j√≥venes m√∫sicos nos llev√≥ a convertirnos en Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Estatal.
Durante 14 a√±os, la Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Estatal de Armenia ha tocado vidas a trav√©s de la m√∫sica cl√°sica. La orquesta realiza m√°s de 50 conciertos al a√±o y tiene un repertorio vers√°til, que abarca desde obras maestras orquestales favoritas de todos los tiempos hasta estrenos de vanguardia de piezas de compositores contempor√°neos armenios y extranjeros.

ASMR Zeitgeist presents a couple of unusual triggers for tingles, sleep and relaxation. Which one is YOUR fave? Drop a comment!

Enjoy with headphones or earbuds to fully experience the binaural sounds. ASMR describes a pleasant physical sensation triggered by various stimuli. Popular triggers are soft voices and whispers but also sounds like tapping, scratching, brushing, or crinkle sounds. Personal attention scenarios are popular, too, like receiving professional ear cleaning or a haircut. Slime and Mukbang ASMR are hugely popular subcategories in the ASMR community. Videos like this are supposed to help you sleep, relax, study, focus, and, most importantly, give you some pleasant ASMR tingles.

There's so many more of these moments out there, it was tough to choose 10. Honorable mention for Bach, in part because he really started it all.

To me, these pieces evoke intensity, speed, rhythmic energy, dark chromatic harmonies, and/or general loudness characteristic of metal music.

===== General Questions =====

Q. What are Binaural Beats?

""Binaural Beats"" is a term given to playing one sound frequency in one ear, and another sound frequency in the opposite ear, creating a two-tone effect in the midbrain that is actually perceived to be one tone. This causes an ""Entrainment"" effect in the brain that has a variety of results depending on the frequency. 

Q. What are Binaural Beats good for?

Lots of things. Meditation, Relaxation, Stress Relief, Deeper Sleep, Pain Relief, Mind Expansion, Brain Hemisphere Synchronization, and the list goes on and on. 

Pretty much any element of the Mind / Body complex can be improved using Binaural Beats, which again is just Brainwave Entrainment. 

Q. Do Binaural Beats Actually Work?

Indeed. Many scientific studies (especially as of late) have conclusive research on Brainwave Entrainment and it's effects. 

Q. Must I wear headphones for these videos? 

You don't have to use headphones, but the Binaural effect is increased if you do. 

Q. Do I need to close my eyes while listening to this?

No, although you'll find closing your eyes will generally lead to a deeper, more profound state while listening.

Then, the drum is sealed, trapping the steam inside the barrel. When we  pour cold water on the barrel, the steam inside the drum condenses, and the pressure inside drops dramatically. However, there is still atmospheric pressure outside, which is now greater than the pressure inside. The atmospheric pressure from outside crushes the drum, and the drum implodes! This is a dramatic demonstration of the power of atmospheric pressure, using nothing more than a 55-gallon drum and basic principles of physics. Remember, don't try this at home!

There's so many more of these moments out there, it was tough to choose 10. Honorable mention for Bach, in part because he really started it all.

To me, these pieces evoke intensity, speed, rhythmic energy, dark chromatic harmonies, and/or general loudness characteristic of metal music.

------------------

A little story from Dr. SaxLove about the song ""Angel Biscuit"":

""Mrs. SaxLove and I were out one evening with friends, got into having drinks and laughs, and decided that nothing could be better than giving ourselves drinking names. Mine was ‚ÄòSaximus Maximus‚Äô (call me Saximus for short).

Somebody suggested Mrs. SaxLove's name should be Angelique Biscotti. We all laughed it up - we thought that was a fine idea.  And in one of those rare and sudden but defining moments, Mrs. SaxLove turned to me, gave me that ‚Äòlook‚Äô and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Angel Biscuit to you.‚Äù

That was even better and funnier and somehow much more intimate. Now, over time, the memory of that particular moment has seasoned into an image-inducing iconic metaphor for those times when friends are good, times are fun, and the creative force of spirit and love flow.

The ‚ÄòAngel Biscuit‚Äô moment. Ah, my little Angel Biscuit...""

""Feeling Good"" Lyrics:
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

For me

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
It's a new life
For me

And I'm feeling good

I'm feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semester‚Äôs end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

Why do blood types matter? - Natalie S. Hodge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfZhb6lmxjk,TED-Ed,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,"Mar 30, 2024, 2:38:10 AM PST",xfZhb6lmxjk,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfZhb6lmxjk/default.jpg,2015-06-29T15:08:30Z,5669204.0,96200.0,0.0,4423.0,"Dig into the 4 main blood types ‚Äî A, B, AB, and O ‚Äî and find out why some bloods can mix while others cannot.

--

It‚Äôs often said that despite humanity‚Äôs many conflicts, we all bleed the same blood. It‚Äôs a nice thought, but not quite accurate. In fact, our blood comes in a few different varieties. Natalie S. Hodge defines the four major blood types and sheds light on why some bloods can mix while others cannot. 

Lesson by Natalie S. Hodge, animation by Brad Purnell.

In this first lecture in the Introductory Calculus course Dan Ciubotaru summarises how the course works and what we expect the new students to already 
know in order to ensure all of them are prepared for the more complex work ahead. 

All first and second year lectures are followed by tutorials where students meet their tutor to go through the lecture and associated problem sheet and to talk and think more about the maths. Third and fourth year lectures are followed by classes.

Regardless of which country you are from, you might think that those getting into top universities are set for life. Because that means you will probably get high-paying jobs in big companies right out of college, right? But what does it mean to get into top universities in the Philippines and how worried are the students about their future and the local economy?
Our Asian Boss reporter was able to visit the University of the Philippines, arguably the most prestigious university in the Philippines, and speak with some of the students there.

new new edit: I got accepted into the Harvard Graduate School of Education (graduate school), not Harvard College (undergrad)
---
new edit: thanks to you all, I finally am eligible to join the YouTube Partnership Program! Since they changed their requirements, I never thought I'd be able to reach it again... but this video and all of you really changed the game!! I can't thank you enough~ I hope y'all find the ads as exciting as I do! hahaha thank you again 
xx,
Katrina
--
edit: I am overwhelmed by the amount of attention this video has gotten. Thank you so much for all your congratulations and warm wishes! It really means a lot to me and all the positive comments make me so happy to read and respond to! :-)

I know a lot of you are interested in stats videos/tips to get into ivy leagues, and I'm honestly so flattered, but I want to announce that I will not be making a video about that... and reason being is honestly because I don't know exactly how I got in. I'm really not the best person to ask because I didn't apply to any ivy leagues/private schools for undergrad (I went to UC Irvine~ zotzot!) and Harvard is the only ivy league I applied to for grad school. I didn't get accepted into all the schools I applied to and ultimately, I think college admissions are way too complex/random/uncertain/by chance to know exactly what got me accepted. I hope you all understand! 

I do have a study tips video on my channel that I made during undergrad--hope this can be helpful!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKkSj5bMtLs 

Lastly, many of you expressed interest for Harvard vlogs and updates once I start school. My program is a really intensive one-year program and I'm not sure how much time I will have. If I have time, I will try my best to vlog a bit for you all though ~

thank you all so much for all the love and support!

in all seriousness im so grateful for the opportunity to apply to all these schools and have these acceptances. i worked my ass off but we all know how f*cked up the American college admission system is and luck / subjectivity / background are definitely factors in this whole process. please please please don't base your self worth or intelligence based on where you got in / didn't get in / are going. anyway, to all my class of 2021 friends, best of luck whatever you decide to pursue after HS! sorry this is a very sappy ending i am sleep deprived

There were many highs and lows throughout the college application process but it all worked out in the end. I hope this video gives you hope and i am wishing you the best of luck!

Also, remember that a deferral or a deny is a redirection. Often times, it is easy to feel down in the moment but looking at the big picture, some doors close so other doors can open. 

College decisions do not define you and regardless of what happens, you should be proud of yourself and all of your hard work!

Stay positive and sending good vibes to you all :)

Whether its single use pointers, pointers to other pointers, pointers to structures, something about the concept drives new programmers crazy. The C programming languages is recognized as one of the most difficult programming languages to learn. The reason for this is the limitless power you have over memory management, which comes from pointers.

In this video, I show you what a pointer is, as it applies to low level memory access. Also, we talk about pointer syntax in C and how you can better understand the pointer syntax by converting it to English. And we wrap the video up by asking ""why do we care?"".

P.S. I watched Fantastic Fungi on Netflix once and simply HAD to make this Saprobe inspired roleplay. It was a ton of fun filming + it gives me strong @angelicasgrass  asmr vibes (they heavily inspired this video)!

Hi! My name is Jocie, and I'm just a human happy to be creating ASMR videos : )

I post what I enjoy, meaning lots of:
MAKEUP & SKINCARE
PERSONAL ATTENTION
FANTASY ROLEPLAYS
& NATURE

New uploads every single week (6 - 8 PM EST)!

For someone who struggles to slow down & be kind to themselves, I find ASMR gives us a chance for pause, encouraging us to take time for self care and to prioritize our mental health. I hope we can all use this channel to practice self love, laugh a little, and relax ‚ô° SUBSCRIBE and join in on the tingles!

Oh btw if you were wondering, ASMR (or –∞—Å–º—Ä in Russian, for SEO :P) is a tingly feeling people get from sounds and visual stimuli (for example whispering, tapping or hand movements), these tingles are very relaxing :) however, even for those who don't experience ASMR the videos often still help them sleep and battle insomnia, like ASMR does for me. I go by Luuk/Obviously, but my Korean fanbase calls me Ïò§Ïä¨Ìù¨ (Oh Seul-Hee) ‚ù§Ô∏è","asmr,[asmr],–∞—Å–º—Ä,tingles,male asmr,obviouslyasmr,obviously,soothing,sounds,triggers,whisper,whispers,whispering,asmr whispering,ear to ear,binaural,relax,relaxing,relaxation,sleep,insomnia,stress relief,stress,asmr sleep,calm down,calming,asmr calming,relaxing video,asmr video,asmr tingles,asmr for sleep,Ïò§Ïä¨Ìù¨,asmr personal attention,light trigger,asmr photoshoot,asmr energy cleaning,asmr affirmations"

Included are original piano works by Piazzolla as well as Jeroen van Veen‚Äôs own arrangements of the famous sets of tangos, and of course the iconic Adi√≥s Nonino.

Composer: Astor Piazzolla
Artists: Jeroen van Veen (piano)

‚ÄòI play with violence,‚Äô Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992) told one interviewer. ‚ÄòMy bandoneon must sing and scream ‚Äì I can‚Äôt conceive of pastel tones in tango.‚Äô With an unrivalled discography of minimalist classics to his credit, from Satie to Glass to Yann Tiersen, Jeroen van Veen is ideally placed to return the raw passion and punchy rhythms that belong to the music of Piazzolla in any context.

Jeroen Van Veen‚Äôs selection runs the gamut of Piazzolla‚Äôs expressive vocabulary, from the tenderly intimate title track and the Impressionist brushstrokes of Oblivion to the tough and defiant Libertango which concludes the album in truly anthemic fashion. CD2 begins with another masterpiece of street music, Adios Nonino. A string of other masterpieces follow, making their effect as surely on the piano as they do on the guitar or Piazzolla‚Äôs own instrument, the bandoneon. There is the simple, sweet sentiment of Ausencias, the flamboyant Street Tango and a collection of six contrasting tangos from 1974, from the dark and swirling Meditango to the grave resignation of Tristango.

Marking the centenary of Piazzolla‚Äôs birth in 1921, this new album pays devoted homage to a composer who came to craft one of the defining sounds of the late 20th-century, when tango left the barrios and clubs of Buenos Aires and then the dance clubs of America and Europe to find a home in recital and concert halls worldwide.

As ‚Äòthe leading exponent of minimalism today‚Äô (Fanfare), Jeroen Van Veen‚Äôs playing will speak to an audience which has never danced a tango in its life but thrills to the undertow of melancholy and dazzling flair that characterises great tango interpreters past and present. ‚ÄòFrom the first time I heard his music, I felt attracted to it,‚Äô says the pianist in his booklet essay. ‚ÄòThe rhythm, the melodic value, the atmosphere, it is hard to describe but it felt like a natural attraction. The kind of feeling that the music is part of your music memory; it was already there.‚Äô

Lyrics:

Is this x defined?
Is f continuous?
How do you find out?
You can use the limit process.

Approach from both sides,
The left and the right and meet.
Im a just a limit, defined analytically

Functions continuous,
Theres no holes,
No sharp points,
Or asymptotes.

Any way this graph goes
It is differentiable for me for me.

All year, in Calculus
Weve learned so many things
About which we are going to sing

We can find derivatives
And integrals
And the area enclosed between two curves.

Y prime oooh
Is the derivative of y
Y equals x to the n, dy/dx
Equals n times x
To the n-1.

Other applications
Of derivatives apply
If y is divided or multiplied
You use the quotient
And product rules

And dont you forget
To do the dance

Also oooh (dont forget the chain rule)
Before you are done,
You gotta remember to multiply by the chain

(Instrumental solo)

I need to find the area under a curve
Integrate! Integrate!  You can use the integration

Raise exponent by one multiply the reciprocal
Plus a constant
Plus a constant
Add a constant
Add a constant
Add a constant labeled C
(Labeled C-ee-ee-ee-ee)

Im just a constant
Nobody loves me.
Hes just a constant
Might as well just call it C 
Never forget to add the constant C

Can you find the area between f and g
In-te-grate f and then integrate g
(then subtract)
To revolve around the y-axis
(integrate)
outer radius squared minus inner radius squared
(multiplied)
multiplied by pi
(multiply)

Multiply the integral by pi!

Pi tastes real good with whipped cream!

Mama-Mia, Mama-Mia
Mama-Mia let me go.
Pre-calculus did not help me to prepare for Calculus, for Calculus, help me! 

So you think you can find out the limit of y?
So you think youll find zero and have it defined
Oh baby cant define that point baby
Its undefined
Goes to positive and negative infinity

Oooh. Oooh yeah, oooh yeah.
Differentiation
Anyone can see
Any mere equation
It is differentiable for me.

ABOUT ME: I'm James Dunne, a runner, sports rehabilitation therapist (similar to physical therapist) and coach based in the UK (Norwich and London). 

Since 2007 I've been working with athletes focusing specifically on helping distance runners and triathletes overcome injury and improve performance through developing their individual running technique. 

Running biomechanics and physical therapy are real passions of mine. I love to help runners run strong and stay injury free.

The dynamic warm up increases blood flow and ""turns on"" muscles that need to be ready to perform once you start running or other endurance exercise. This preparation for your activity will help improve movement patterns and decrease any inefficiencies or gait abnormalities in order to increase your performance and decrease the risk of injury.

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Hans Zimmer - Interstellar - Main Theme
Piano Version by Patrik Pietschmann

Hi, my name is Patrik Pietschmann, I'm a keyboard player, arranger and hobby programmer from Germany. Since I am a huge fan of Hans Zimmer, I did an arrangement of his Main Theme from the ""Interstellar"" soundtrack. In this video I have tried to combine my live piano playing with the visualization of the music material by programming my own ""Synthesia""-like software.

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Open your Heart Chakra, heal your Heart by letting go of fear, anxiety, stress and worries! This specially composed meditation music combines the healing frequencies of 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz and will lovingly accompany you on your journey.

Also called the ‚Äúfrequency of Gods‚Äù, the 963Hz Solfeggio frequency is said to awaken any system to its original, perfect state, as well as to assist in the process of Pineal Gland activation and Third Eye opening. Its tone helps us return to Oneness, to our very source. If you feel disconnected with the rest of the world, the 963 Hz frequency can help complete your awakening with the interconnectedness and Oneness of the Universe. Listening to the frequency of 963 Hz can also strengthen the sense of community and belonging, or restore it if necessary.

639 Hz is a frequency our Heart Chakra resonates with. Our Heart Chakra is the fourth Chakra and the center of the seven Chakras with three Chakras below and three Chakras above. It is the center, the area where physical and spiritual meet. Our Heart Chakra stands for the ability to give and receive Love and forgiveness. It is the center of hope, trust, compassion and inspiration.¬†When our Heart Chakra is open, we may feel being deeply connected, the harmonious exchange of energy with all that is around us, and the appreciation of beauty. 

In the Solfeggio scale, the 396Hz frequency is known to help overcome fear, which usually presents the main obstacle when it comes to realising our dreams and goals. The 396 hz Solfeggio frequency also liberates from negative beliefs, convictions and thoughts, even on a subconscious level. It helps overcome sadness and grief in difficult moments of life and to find our way back to consolation, inner peace and profound joy ‚òÄÔ∏è

You can find more of my Solfeggio healing frequency music in this playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXwfGygOmeUUyUc4dXhbrATvPt5AW4nRC

For this meditation music, all instruments have been specifically and carefully tuned to 963 Hz + 639 Hz + 396 Hz. These are frequencies, our heart chakra, pineal gland and third eye resonate with and can help overcome and let go of fear, anxiety, worries and stress. The meditation music in this video is an original 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz composition and has not been artificially tuned to 963 Hz + 639 Hz + 396 Hz afterwards. I am convinced that composing music in the original frequency will lead to better results when it comes to deploying the positive energy and benefits of the healing frequencies of 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz. 


Feel free to listen to this 963Hz + 639Hz + 396Hz Open Up to the Universe | Heart Chakra & Let Go | Healing Meditation Music with headphones or - if you prefer - just let it flow through open space. As long as it is positive for you, it will be positive for your body and soul. 

Love and gratitude üíñüôèüèº

Oh btw if you were wondering, ASMR (or –∞—Å–º—Ä in Russian :P) is a tingly feeling people get from sounds and visual stimuli (for example whispering, tapping or hand movements), these tingles are very relaxing :) however, even for those who don't experience ASMR the videos often still help them sleep and battle insomnia

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Hans Zimmer - Interstellar - Main Theme
Piano Version by Patrik Pietschmann

Hi, my name is Patrik Pietschmann, I'm a keyboard player, arranger and hobby programmer from Germany. Since I am a huge fan of Hans Zimmer, I did an arrangement of his Main Theme from the ""Interstellar"" soundtrack. In this video I have tried to combine my live piano playing with the visualization of the music material by programming my own ""Synthesia""-like software.

VERY IMPORTANT.... Some subscribers have told me they are not getting notification of when I upload a new video. YouTube has been working on this issue. I am pleased to inform all my subscribers that if you click on the bell at the right side of the red subscription button, you should receive a notification from YouTube that I will be uploading something new on a particular day and time.  
I will only be putting up notifications once or twice a month. 
One advantage of doing this on my channel is that when I premier a new video you have the opportunity to chat with me as well if you wish

In horizontal blocks there are 3 rows, a top , a middle, and a bottom.
Each of these rows cannot have a number repeated.  By using combinations of TMB you avoid repeating a number in a row.  
If you notice that there is one empty cell immediately fill that number in by counting up to 9.

It's fun when you have solved a puzzle.  This puzzle is very easy.  It's great to start out using this system for all puzzles. I am the only one on the internet that teaches this procedure.

Warning !!  the biggest mistake beginners make is that they try difficult puzzles to soon.

RULES:
The object of the game is to correctly fill in all the empty spaces with the correct numbers.  The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares. Each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1 through 9 within its squares without any duplicates or omissions. Each vertical 9-square column and each horizontal 9-square row must also contain all the numbers 1 through 9 within its squares without any duplicates or omissions. You may only put one number in each square, unless they are notes, which you indicate by making them smaller. Using logic, reasoning, and deduction, you must figure out every box in the grid so that all the rows, columns, and blocks all hold to the rules without conflicting each other. Every Sudoku has exactly 1 correct solution. Once you have filled in all the squares with the correct numbers, you win!","board game,how to,Tutorial,instructions,rules,how to play,How to play Sudoku,how to play soduko,sudoku,soduko"

Get this game on the app store here: https://link.triplesgames.com/minesweeper 
RULES:

The object of the game is to uncover the map without clicking on any mines. Open a new game then left click randomly until you uncover some space and information to work with. If you click on a mine, you lose the game. Click on the smiley face to start a new game. A numbered square indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square either above, below, right, left or diagonally. Spaces not adjacent to any mines are blank, showing no number. The lowest number is 1 and the highest is 8. Using reason and deduction, use the known information from the revealed numbers to figure out where the mines are located. Right click to flag a spot you know where a mine is. Right click on a flagged to clear the mark. You will be unable to accidentally left click a marked square. If you perform a right and left click simultaneously on a number that has the corresponding number of flags adjacent to it, it will open all the squares surrounding that number that don‚Äôt have flags. You can also left click on the number to accomplish this. Once all the mines have been properly marked and the rest of the board cleared, you win.","board game,how to,Tutorial,instructions,rules,how to play,How to play Minesweeper,minesweeper,mine sweeper,how to play mine sweeper"

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.
Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.

He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

That said, there are some genuine signs of intelligence people can't fake - even if they try to fool you! Also, there's more to intelligence than just high IQ. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is just as important, especially when it comes to empathy.

Essentially, there are many aspects to human intelligence. However, certain traits and behavioral patterns can be recognized in those who possess a high intellect.

The idea for Nintendo‚Äôs Game Boy system was born from a philosophy that had a much less catchy name: lateral thinking with withered technology.

The term was coined by Gunpei Yokoi, a Nintendo employee who started at the company with a similarly dry job: machine maintenance worker. One day, a Nintendo executive noticed that Yokoi had built a simple extendable-arm-grabber toy in his free time. Let‚Äôs sell it, the executive said. It became a small hit.

Yokoi was eventually promoted to help build out the company‚Äôs video game business. But he recognized that he didn‚Äôt have the expertise to advance the cutting edge of the video game world. So he decided on a very specific strategy: take already well-understood knowledge and technology from different domains and combine them in unique ways to create new products. The result was the Game Boy.

In this interview with Big Think, David Epstein, author of the 2019 book ""Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World,"" explains how lateral thinking ‚Äî a type of thinking where you approach problems from non-obvious angles ‚Äî is a problem-solving strategy that‚Äôs surprisingly well-suited for our fast-changing world.

OVERVIEW:

James Gleick, who wrote a biography of Isaac Newton, describes the reclusive scientist as ""antisocial, unpleasant and bitter."" Newton fought with his friends ""as much as with his enemies,"" Gleick says. In contrast, Richard Feynman, the subject of another Gleick biography, was ""gregarious, funny, a great dancer."" The superficial differences between the men go on and on. ""Isaac Newton, I believe, never had sex,"" Gleick says. ""Richard Feynman, I believe, had plenty.""

So what could these two men possibly have in common? According to Gleick, when it came to making the great discoveries of science, both men were alone in their heads. This also applies to great geniuses like Charles Babbage, Alan Turing and Ada Byron.  ""They all had the ability to concentrate with a sort of intensity that is hard for mortals like me to grasp,"" Gleick says, ""a kind of passion for abstraction that doesn't lend itself to easy communication.""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JAMES GLEICK:

James Gleick was born in New York City in 1954. He graduated from Harvard College in 1976 and helped found Metropolis, an alternative weekly newspaper in Minneapolis. Then he worked for ten years as an editor and reporter for The New York Times.

His first book, Chaos, was a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize finalist and a national bestseller. He collaborated with the photographer Eliot Porter on Nature's Chaos and with developers at Autodesk on Chaos: The Software. His next books include the best-selling biographies, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman and Isaac Newton, both shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, as well as Faster and What Just Happened. They have been translated into twenty-five languages.

In 1989-90 he was the McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at Princeton University. For some years he wrote the Fast Forward column in the New York Times Magazine.

With Uday Ivatury, he founded The Pipeline, a pioneering New York City-based Internet service in 1993, and was its chairman and chief executive officer until 1995. He was the first editor of the Best American Science Writing series. He is active on the boards of the Authors Guild and the Key West Literary Seminar.

This is because abstraction is a function of language.

Whether you're learning matters related to science, spirituality or any aspect of reality, the Memory Palace technique will help you, but...

Only if you have the tools needed for the job.

Today's study tips will be useful for you if you need to think conceptually and remember the abstract ideas involved. 

And I give a TON of mnemonic examples that I hope will help you out.

This video updates my 2013 video:

Memorize Concepts Using A Memory Palace

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM

For more help, you can also get my full podcast and article on abstract thinking:

https://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/abstract-thinking/

It includes some mental exercises that will help you even further, including when it comes to the matter of symbolism.

Enjoy and thanks as always for your great comments and support of the Magnetic Memory Method initiative!

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

‚ÄòI play with violence,‚Äô Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992) told one interviewer. ‚ÄòMy bandoneon must sing and scream ‚Äì I can‚Äôt conceive of pastel tones in tango.‚Äô With an unrivalled discography of minimalist classics to his credit, from Satie to Glass to Yann Tiersen, Jeroen van Veen is ideally placed to return the raw passion and punchy rhythms that belong to the music of Piazzolla in any context.

Jeroen Van Veen‚Äôs selection runs the gamut of Piazzolla‚Äôs expressive vocabulary, from the tenderly intimate title track and the Impressionist brushstrokes of Oblivion to the tough and defiant Libertango which concludes the album in truly anthemic fashion. CD2 begins with another masterpiece of street music, Adios Nonino. A string of other masterpieces follow, making their effect as surely on the piano as they do on the guitar or Piazzolla‚Äôs own instrument, the bandoneon. There is the simple, sweet sentiment of Ausencias, the flamboyant Street Tango and a collection of six contrasting tangos from 1974, from the dark and swirling Meditango to the grave resignation of Tristango.

Marking the centenary of Piazzolla‚Äôs birth in 1921, this new album pays devoted homage to a composer who came to craft one of the defining sounds of the late 20th-century, when tango left the barrios and clubs of Buenos Aires and then the dance clubs of America and Europe to find a home in recital and concert halls worldwide.

As ‚Äòthe leading exponent of minimalism today‚Äô (Fanfare), Jeroen Van Veen‚Äôs playing will speak to an audience which has never danced a tango in its life but thrills to the undertow of melancholy and dazzling flair that characterises great tango interpreters past and present. ‚ÄòFrom the first time I heard his music, I felt attracted to it,‚Äô says the pianist in his booklet essay. ‚ÄòThe rhythm, the melodic value, the atmosphere, it is hard to describe but it felt like a natural attraction. The kind of feeling that the music is part of your music memory; it was already there.‚Äô

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.
Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.

He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)

Astor Pantale√≥n Piazzolla (March 11, 1921 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style termed nuevo tango, incorporating elements from jazz and classical music. A virtuoso bandoneonist, he regularly performed his own compositions with a variety of ensembles. In 1992, American music critic Stephen Holden described Piazzolla as ""the world's foremost composer of Tango music"". (Source: Wikipedia)
